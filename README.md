# Unconditional Image Generation

This project involved developing and training a diffusion model from scratch inspired by the architecture of Stable Diffusion. The model was trained using PyTorch framework.

## Dataset 

The dataset used is the MNIST (digits) dataset. It consists of 70,000 labeled grayscale images of hand-written digits, each 28x28 pixels in size.

## Architecture

A modified U-Net architecture which comprises of multi-headed self attention, residual connections and time embeddings.
