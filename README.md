# Unconditional Image Generation

This project involved developing and training a diffusion model from scratch inspired by the architecture of Stable Diffusion. The model was trained using PyTorch framework. A diffusion probabilistic model is a parameterized Markov chain trained using variational inference to produce samples matching the data after finite time. Transitions of this chain are learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the data in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. 

## Dataset 

The dataset used is the MNIST (digits) dataset. It consists of 70,000 labeled grayscale images of hand-written digits, each 28x28 pixels in size.
Some sample images from the dataset are shown :
